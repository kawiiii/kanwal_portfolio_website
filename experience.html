                        <h4 class="role">Research Contributor (6 Weeks: July â€“ August 2024)</h4>
                        <p>Collaborated with a global research team to develop a novel approach for Multilingual Machine Generated Text Portion Detection. Addressing the limitations of traditional AI-text detectors, I utilized transformer models enhanced with a CRF layer, achieving 99.5% accuracy on unseen domains and generators in DAIGenC-Task-2. I also contributed in the creation of a multilingual dataset with over 1.5M samples across 23 languages, significantly improving detection of short AI-generated text segments. This research will be presented at ACL 2025, with plans to expand into multimodal content detection for images, audio, and video.</p>

                        <p>Collaborated with a diverse research team spanning Hamilton Health Services, and institutions including UBC, McMaster, and TMU to predict emergency department visits using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enhancing healthcare planning and patient well-being. By combining data mining techniques with insights from medical literature, I extracted key features, enhancing the interpretability and clinical relevance of the predictive models. Additionally, I engineered baseline ML and DL models to establish performance benchmarks and facilitate meaningful comparisons, achieving a ROC AUC of 0.7974. Overall, my contributions played a vital role in achieving the project's objectives and outcomes.</p>
